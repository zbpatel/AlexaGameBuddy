Game Buddy is a skill for Amazon Alexa developed by Zac Patel
This skill can be considered a "2.0" version of my previous skill GameHelper.
Rather than just pushing an update to that skill, I decided to make a new
version because I wanted to make some changes to the structure of how the skill
is written. It has been nearly 6 months since I wrote the previous app, and I
have learned a lot about how to write better skills in the meantime, but I
didn't want to start from scratch because I wanted to keep some of the error
trapping code and basic code framework that would have been nearly identical
anyways if I had rewritten it anyways.

Any of the games that this app provides help for are the properties of their
respective owners. I enjoy playing all of the games this app supports, and I
wanted to make a tool that might be fun for other people who enjoy them as much
as I do.

In addition, part of this rebuild was to move the skill onto the new interaction
model in the hopes of increasing the usability of the skill (and maybe fixing
that old issue with the number 2)
